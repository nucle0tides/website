      Hi, I&apos;m <span>Gabby Ortman</span>. I am a software engineer based in Kansas City, Missouri.

      You may find me ordering an iced mocha from either Monarch or Broadway Coffee, running, terraforming my Animal Crossing island, planning my next road trip to the Pacific Northwest, camping, hiking, and spoiling my dog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/antoninus.pius.dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pius</a>, and rabbit, <span>Smalls</span>. 
    </p>

      I studied computer science at <span>Iowa State University</span> and graduated in 2017. While there, I kept myself busy running <a href="http://digitalwomen.ece.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Women</a>, acting as a student liason on the <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu/student-advisory-council" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Science Student Advisory Council</a>, participating in <span>hackathons</span>, and volunteering at STEM events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, I was a software engineer at <a href="https://www.storable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Storable</a> (formerly <span>Red Nova Labs</span>). Before <span>Storable</span>, I did three software engineering internships in Kansas City.

      If you want to chat about my dog, the bugs I've personally introduced at work, why I'm not using <em>[really cool webpack plugin]</em> on my website, or need a recommendation on where to get coffee in Midtown/Westport, Kansas City, feel free to contact me by <a href="mailto:hi@gabbyortman.com">email</a>.
